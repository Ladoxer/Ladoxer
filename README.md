> "He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into coding excellence." – Ladoxer's Nietzschean dev philosophy

## Who Am I?
I'm Ladoxer, a full-stack developer who builds digital solutions by day and debugs life by night. 4+ years of turning coffee into code across web and mobile platforms, creating my own values in a world of technological chaos.

## The Ladoxer Files 📁
- The name "Ladoxer" emerged from my will to power in the digital realm [ladoxer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed-labeeb-u-64a7a323b)
- I code with a hammer, philosophizing through algorithms and functions
- What doesn't break my code makes my repositories stronger
- I dance between frontend and backend, for one must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star

> "To live is to debug, and to debug is to suffer—but in that suffering lies greatness." - Ladoxer's coding manifesto
